- Developed an 8-channel microphone array system for sound source localization (SSL) by an urban mobile robot
- Recorded a dataset using a sound source and motion capturing for SSL by means of deep neural networks
- Attended seminars and obtained deeper knowledge of research in intelligent mobility, robotics, and machine learning

Done during my research Internship at the Autonomous Intelligent Systems (AIS) Lab, University of Freiburg
